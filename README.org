* What's this?
  
  This is a extension of Emacs that is a perspective of [[https://github.com/kiwanami/emacs-window-manager][e2wm.el]] for work in terminal.

  [[file:img/demo.gif][demo]]

  
* Feature

  - invoke command by not a newline key but a dedicated key for avoiding an unintended invocation.
  - command can be written as multiline because a newline key just inputs a linefeed.
  - show a help of the command, which you are typing to invoke, automatically into a dedicated window.
  - show any help command result into not a terminal window but a dedicated window.
  - show comand histories into a dedicated window and access them quickly.

    - [[https://github.com/aki2o/yaxception][yaxception.el]]
      
      
* Configuration

*** First

    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(require 'e2wm-term)
    #+END_SRC

*** Choice default backend

    Backend means a kind of feature as terminal shown in main window.  
    When this perspective is started at first, =e2wm-term:default-backend= is used ('shell in default).  
    For check available backend, do M-x =e2wm-term:show-backends=.  
    For the detail, do M-x =e2wm-term:describe-backend=.  

*** Define key to invoke command

    In default, the keystroke is =C-RET=.  
    If you want to change it, add key to =e2wm-term:input-mode-map= like the following.  

    #+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(e2wm:add-keymap
 e2wm-term:input-mode-map
 '(("C-m" . e2wm-term:input-invoke-command)
   ) e2wm:prefix-key)
    #+END_SRC

*** Guess help command

    this perspective handles the command to show a help by the value of =e2wm-term:help-guess-command=.  
    
    - It's =t= ... always put the result into help window without the invocation in main window.
    - It's =ask= (default) ... ask whether to put the result into help window.
    - It's =nil= ... always invoke the command in main window.

    Also, =e2wm-term:help-guess-regexp= is used for a judgment of whether the command is a help command.  
    In default, the value matches the command includes "help" as a word like "git help status".  

    Also, the command includes "--help" option always is handled as a help command.  

*** Show current command help

    While user input a command string in input window,
    a help of the active command is shown in help window automatically by =e2wm-term:command-helper=.  

*** Current work directory

    A header of input window shows a current work directory of self.  
    A update of it is done by =e2wm-term:command-cwd-checker= / =e2wm-term:command-cwd-updaters=.  

*** Pager

    For pager configuration in main window, use =e2wm-term:command-pager= / =e2wm-term:command-pager-variables=.  
    Values of environment variables of =e2wm-term:command-pager-variables= are replaced
    with =e2wm-term:command-pager= at a start of thie perspective.  

*** Other

    For check all config items, do M-x =customize-group= "e2wm-term".  

    
* Usage

*** Start perspective

    M-x =e2wm-term:dp= or M-x =e2wm:pst-change-command= then select =term=.  

*** Input and invoke command

    Input a invoked command string without a escape of linefeed even if it's multiline.  
    Then, push the key bound to =e2wm-term:input-invoke-command=.  

*** Control terminal window

    A terminal of active backend is shown in main window.  
    You are able to control the terminal in input window by the same key as the terminal key map.  
    For example, =comint-interrupt-subjob= runs in main window by pushing =C-c C-c= in input window.  

    - However, the =e2wm-term:input-mode-map= keys are excepted

*** Access history window

    You are able to access command histories by the following keys.  
    =prefix= means =e2wm:prefix-key=.  

    - =e2wm-term:history-move-previous= ( =C-c C-p= / =prefix p= ) ... move to a previous history
    - =e2wm-term:history-move-next= ( =C-c C-n= / =prefix n= ) ... move to a next history
    - =e2wm-term:input-history-previous= ( =M-p= ) ... move to a previous history and past that into input window
    - =e2wm-term:input-history-next= ( =M-n= ) ... move to a next history and past that into input window
    - =e2wm-term:history-send-pt-point= ( =prefix i= ) ... yank a current history
    - =e2wm-term:history-grep= ( =prefix g= ) ... grep histories
    - =e2wm-term:history-show-all= ( =prefix a= ) ... show all histories ( for turn back from grep )

*** Control help window

    =e2wm-term:help-mode=, which is a major mode for help window, inherits =view-mode=.  
    Then, for quit from help window, push =q=.  
    Also, there are the following keys to control a help window.  

    - =e2wm-term:dp-help-toggle-command= ( =prefix h= ) ... toggle on/off of display of a help window
    - =e2wm-term:dp-help-maximize-toggle-command= ( =prefix H= ) ... toggle on/off of maximized of a help window

*** Select terminal buffer

    When the buffer of active backend is plural,
    you are able to select them by =e2wm-term:dp-select-main-buffer= ( =prefix t= ).  

*** Add backend

    use =e2wm-term:regist-backend=.  

    
* Consideration

*** Pager

    In general, terminal uses a interactive program like "less" command
    as the pager program which is used for a browse of long results of command.  
    But, such interactive program can not be controled from input window.  
    So, this perspective uses "cat" command, which is not a interactive program, as pager in default.  
    About that configuration, see "Pager" section in "Configuration" above.  

*** Command termination in multiline

    A command termination, ( e.g. ";" in /bin/sh ), can be skipped in terminal like the following.  

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
~$ for e in `ls`
> do
> echo $e
> done
    #+END_SRC

    But, you have to input command with a command termination in input window like the following.  

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
for e in `ls`;
do
echo $e;
done
    #+END_SRC
